        <h2>About IEEE C57.104-2019 <abbr title="IEEE Guide for the Interpretation of Gases
            Generated in Mineral Oil-Immersed Transformers"></abbr>
        </h2>
        <p class="pl-3 pr-3" style="text-align:justify">
             IEEE C57.104-2019 is a standard for the interpretation of dissolved gas 
             analysis (DGA) in transformer oil. It provides guidelines for the detection
             and interpretation of gases dissolved in transformer oil, which can 
             indicate the presence of potential problems in the transformer such as 
             overheating, arcing, or aging of the insulation. The standard includes 
             information on the normal levels of dissolved gases, as well as the 
             levels that indicate potential problems. It also provides guidelines for 
             the interpretation of DGA results, including the use of ratio analysis to 
             determine the potential cause of any abnormalities. Additionally, it 
             provides guidance on sampling, testing, and reporting of DGA results.

        <h2>
            DGA Analysis Tools Used in this Website
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            There are many popular methods to assess the DGA reports like key gas method, 
            rogers ratio, duval triangles and pentagon method. Among them here in this 
            website we have particularly put our focus on rogers ratios and duval triangles
            (1,4,5) method, as manual assessment and detection of fault types using these
            methods are quite tedious and time consuming, specially when you have to 
            analyze many reports. But gradually we will include other analysis in this 
            website as well.

        <h3>
            Rogers Ratios
        </h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            IEEE C57.104-2019 standard includes the use of Rogers Ratios, which are a set 
            of mathematical ratios used to interpret the results of DGA testing. The 
            ratios are used to determine the level of degradation or fault within the 
            transformer, and are calculated by dividing the concentration of a specific 
            dissolved gas by the concentration of another specific gas. 
            <br>
            The following table shows the summary of rogers ratios method taken from 
            <cite><a
                href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/C57.104/7476/"
                target="_blank">IEEE C57.104-2019</a>
            </cite> (Table-5) standard.

            The values of these ratios are used to indicate the presence and severity of 
            different types of faults in the transformer, such as partial discharge, 
            overheating, and insulation breakdown. The standard also includes guidelines 
            for interpreting the results of DGA testing, including recommended action 
            levels for each ratio.

        <h3>
            Duval Triangles
        </h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            Duval's triangle is a graphical representation of the performance 
            characteristics of a generator or motor as defined in the 
            IEEE C57.104-2019 DGA (Dissolved Gas Analysis) standard. The triangle 
            is divided into three regions, each representing a different type of 
            electrical equipment failure.
            <br>
            The triangles (1,4,5) are used to interpret dissolved gas analysis results
            and to identify potential issues with electrical equipment. The triangles 
            are also used to compare results from different samples and to determine 
            if a problem is getting worse over time.
